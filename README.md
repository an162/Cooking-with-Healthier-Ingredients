# Cooking-with-Healthier-Ingredients
Cooking with Healthier Ingredients is a c++ programme that suggests healthier substutions according to the users health concerns


This program helps
users choose healthier ingredients when cooking, and helps those allergic to certain foods (e.g.,
gluten) find substitutes. The program read an ingredient of a recipe from the user and suggest healthier replacements for it. For simplicity, this program uses numerical digits
for quantities (e.g., 1 egg, 2/3 cups) rather than spelling them out (one egg, two cups). the program displays warnings such as, “Always consult your physician before making significant changes to your diet.”

ingredients such as sugar will be suggested.
